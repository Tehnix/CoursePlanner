CoursePlanner
=============

Automatically calculate how many ECTS points you've passed, are taking currently, and have upcoming. It also puts your courses into the four categories that DTU requires you to have, namely technology core, nature sciences, electives and project based courses. 


It's only tested with a Bsc, but should somewhat work with Msc also.
